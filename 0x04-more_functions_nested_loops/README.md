# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

*Description or function of all the programs in this directory are listed below.*

* 0-isupper.c :- a function that checks for **uppercase** character.
  * Returns `1` if `c` is **uppercase**
  * Returns `0` otherwise

* 1-isdigit.c :-  a function that checks for a **digit** (`0` through `9`).
  * Returns `1` if `c` is a **digit**
  * Returns `0` otherwise

* 2-mul.c :- a function that `multiplies` **two integers** and **returns** the result.

* 3-print_numbers.c :- a function that **prints** the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line using only the `_putchar()` function.

* 4-print_most_numbers.c :- a function that **prints** the numbers, from `0` to `9`, except `2` and `4`, followed by a new line using only the `_putchar()` function.

* 5-more_numbers.c :-  a function that **prints** `10 times` the numbers from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line using only the `_putchar()` function.

* 6-print_line.c :- a function that draws a `straight line` in the terminal using only the `_putchar` function.
  * `n` is the **number of times** the character `_` is printed
  * The line ends with a `\n`
  * If `n` is `0 or less`, the function should only print `\n`

* 7-print_diagonal.c :- a function that draws a `diagonal line` on the terminal using only the `_putchar` function.
  * `n` is the **number of times** the character `\` is printed
  * The diagonal ends with a `\n`
  * If `n` is `0 or less`, the function should only print `\n`

* 8-print_square.c :- a function that **draws** a `square` on the terminal using only the `_putchar` function.
  * `size` is the size of the square
  * Uses the character `#` to print the square
  * If `size` is `0 or less`, the function should only print `\n`

* 9-fizz_buzz.c :-  a program that **prints the numbers** from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of `3` print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of `5` print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both `3` and `5` print `FizzBuzz`.
  * Each number or word are separated by a `space`

* 10-print_triangle.c :- a function that draws a `triangle` on the terminal using only the `_putchar` function.
  * `size` is the size of the trinagle
  * Uses the character `#` to print the square
  * If `size` is `0 or less`, the function should only print `\n`

* 100-prime_factor.c :- a program that **finds and prints** the largest `prime factor` of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* 101-print_number.c :- a function that **prints** an `integer` using only the `_putchar()` function.
